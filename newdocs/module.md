Box2D (v2.3.1) module for the Wonkey language

Box2D is a 2D physics simulation lib for games made by Erin Catto (box2d.org)

This is a sligthly modified version, for better Wonkley compatibility.

See modules/box2d/LICENSE.txt for original Box2D License.

Original Box2D uses methods called "Step", which is a Wonkey Keyword. These Methods have been renamed into "Stepp".
